# Technical Skills I used in this project
* Programming Languages: Python
* Python Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn
* Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest
# Overview: We used logistic regression and decision tree models to predict staff attrition.  The random forest model was 96.2% accurate in identifying significant characteristics such as project count, overtime hours, and tenure in attrition.

# Stakeholders required to understand the causes of employee turnover.  According to the analysis, overwork and tenure-related unhappiness were important factors.

# Data Analysis: Used HR employee data, including project counts, average monthly hours, and years at the organization.

# Modeling and evaluation included logistic regression and decision tree models.  Following feature engineering, random forest outperformed with 96.2% accuracy and 93.8% AUC.

# Conclusion: Employees are overworked, and prolonged tenure may lead to unhappiness.  Project caps, overtime restrictions, and a review of evaluation processes are among the recommendations.
